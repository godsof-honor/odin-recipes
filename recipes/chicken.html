        <h2 id="chicken-steps-header">Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <div class="chicken-steps">
                <li>Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water.
                    Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 
                    hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.
                </li>
                <li>Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper 
                    in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface.
                     Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
                </li>
                <li>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times 
                    to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.</li>
                <li>Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center 
                    and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                    should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
                </li>
            </div>
        </ol>
